# ECommerce React Template
As an owner of a small business, I need a simple and responsive website using React that I can use to sell my products. 


## Quick Start

```javascript
// Install dependencies for server & client
npm install && npm run client-install

// Run client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

// Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
