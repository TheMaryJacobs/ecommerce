# ECommerce React Template
As an owner of a small business, I need a simple and responsive website using React that I can use to sell my products. 


## Quick Start

```javascript
// Install dependencies for server & client
npm install && npm run client-install

// Run client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

// Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

## Design Customization
Your store's appearance is highly customizable. The main components we suggest starting off styling live within /client/src/app.css. If you wish to customize your store even further, each react component has its own style sheet within client/src/components/... that can be used to customize even further.

#### Fonts
To customize your store's fonts, select 1-3 styles from <https://fonts.google.com> then copy the embed font link in <link> tags into the <head> of /client/public/index.html.

Jump to [/client/public/index.html](#anchor)

To change fonts across the site, you will need to edit /client/src/app.css. This file is where the main element colors and styles live.

#### Colors 
Within /client/src/app.css - you can adjust colors in common places by finding all instances of the same color, and editing them together.
